# gql-io

OFFICIAL STATUS: Nothing to see here.

### For the super curious

This is a personal PoC to see how light, but robust a GraphQL client can be.
Specifically, I'm in need of a GraphQL client that does a good job of communicating
with a GraphQL server from a node client.  Additionally, I'm a massive fan of
[`io-ts`](https://github.com/gcanti/io-ts) so it looks at that for doing
deserialization of the response that comes back from the server.

So far, it just works, which is a promising start at least.

For any example usage, I would suggest taking a look at the `src/test/` directory.
